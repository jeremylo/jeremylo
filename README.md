### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeremy, a final-year computer science MEng student at University College London, music and language lover, and northerner down south. I was recently a Production Engineering intern at Meta (Facebook) London working on the Disaster Recovery team.

I'm currently Head of Development at the [UCL Artificial Intelligence Society](https://uclaisociety.co.uk/), primarily working on [DOXA](http://doxaai.com/): a powerful platform for hosting engaging artificial intelligence competitions.
